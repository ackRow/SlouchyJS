# SlouchyJS
```
What do using computer and body building have in common ? Your posture matters
```
## Background
Like many of us, I have spent more and more time in front of a computer in the last decade.
I’ve always tried to be healthy and listen to my body, therefore I’ve been quite surprised when my trapezius muscles started feeling tight and sometimes even painful.
At first, I thought that maybe I didn’t stretch enough after exercising myself. But the discomfort occurred even when I didn’t do sport for several days.
After mentioning it to a doctor, he immediately ask me if I often worked on a computer.
It was right on the mark !
Poor posture when sitting in front of a computer lead sooner or later to muscular tension if not pain.
This is how I realised that the importance of a good sitting posture is rarely mentioned in our digital world.
## Idea
So when I stumbled upon a GitHub project trying to notify slouchy people, it immediately kept my attention.
Unfortunately, the source code (in Python) wasn’t up to date and I didn’t manage to run it on my MacBook.
10 python versions and libraries installed later, I said to myself :
Why not doing it using the brand new `Tensorflow JS` so that anybody could use this app without having to struggle installing dependencies.

## Project
As you’ve (hopefully) understood SlouchyJS promises to notify the user when he is slouching using only his webcam and a convolutional neural network (or other image recognition techniques).
The clear benefit of using front end Javascript to process images lay in keeping webcam pictures on the user’s computer.
